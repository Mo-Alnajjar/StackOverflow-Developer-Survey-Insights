# Key Factors Impacting Developer Satisfaction, Work Preferences, and Income Trends
In this project I have tried to answering question that related to business, these questions are:
  1- What factors contribute most to job satisfaction among developers?

  2 - What factors influence a developer's decision to prefer remote work?

  3 - What programming languages or technologies are correlated with higher income? 

  Every question is answered in different Jupyter notebook.
